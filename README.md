Maybe a reddit git clone, nobody knows
------

    <blha303> what i want is revision control for reddit comments
    <blha303> but, like, with git
    <blha303> so every comment is a git repo
    <blha303> like github gists
    <blha303> well, every comment that gets edited
    <blha303> normal comments can just be text, so you can check out a
              reddit thread and it's like a tree of directories for each
              comment level
    <blha303> but with git submodules for edited comments
    <blha303> that would be an interesting system to implement
