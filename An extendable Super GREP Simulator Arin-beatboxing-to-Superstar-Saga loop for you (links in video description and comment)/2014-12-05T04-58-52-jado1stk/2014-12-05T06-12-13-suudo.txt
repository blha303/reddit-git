I thought about doing this when I first saw the video ages ago, but I couldn't find a good Arin-beatboxing clip. Then I watched every single one of the Game Grumps compilations and found a lot of great clips :D

If you like the 33s version, how about a 15m version I just uploaded for the video description? I've been listening to this on repeat in foobar for an hour and it loops perfectly at the end of the track. Just checked, and it does the same thing in iTunes and on an iPhone. http://blha303.com.au/greploop_15m.mp3
